We've been kicking [cucumber-chef](https://github.com/Atalanta/cucumber-chef) 2.1 around for a couple of weeks and finally achieved full end-to-end-ness with the latest rc releases the other day (thanks [@zpatten](https://github.com/zpatten)). This should get you up and running with a test lab and a sample cucumber feature (with a bit of [librarian](https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian) thrown in for free).

Dependencies
============

You'll need Oracle's [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), and [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/). I'm assuming you're using [RVM](https://rvm.io/), too.

How to play
===========

    git clone git://github.com/theodi/cuke-chef.git
    cd cuke-chef
    bundle
    librarian-chef install
    cucumber-chef setup

This takes ages, you should go and make some tea or something (you can watch the logs with ```tail -f .cucumber-chef/cucumber-chef.log``` if you're into that sort of thing).

When it's done, you can run the sample cuke with

    cucumber --tags @superawesomeserver

Everything should be green. If you see red, _I really want to hear about it, please_.

Remember to ```cucumber-chef destroy``` your test lab before attempting to provision another one or Vagrant will sulk and refuse to play.

Not really sure if this will be useful to anybody else just yet, I think it's more about me getting my ducks in a row for now. But expect more interesting things when we actually start building out some intrastructure...

Fetching data bags
==================

To run your tests, you need local copies of the data bags from the live chef server. You can do this like so:

```
mkdir -p data_bags/envs
knife data bag show envs development --format json > data_bags/envs/development.json
knife data bag show envs production --format json > data_bags/envs/production.json
mkdir -p data_bags/{your_app}
knife data bag show {your_app} database --format json > data_bags/{your_app}/database.json
```
