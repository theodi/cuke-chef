Feature: Build a fully-operational battlestation^W git-viewer.labs.theodi.org node from scratch

  In order to run the git data viewer app
  As the ODI
  I want to install and configure many things

  Background:
    * I have a server called "git-data-viewer"
    * "git-data-viewer" is running "ubuntu" "precise"
    * "git-data-viewer" should be persistent

    * the following environment has been uploaded:
      | environment | environment_path |
      | cucumber.rb | ./environments/  |

    * the following roles have been uploaded:
      | role         | role_path |
      | *.rb  | ./roles/  |

    * "git-data-viewer" is in the "cucumber" environment
    * "git-data-viewer" has been provisioned

    * all of the cookbooks in "./cookbooks" have been uploaded
    * all of the cookbooks in "./site-cookbooks" have been uploaded

    * the following databags have been updated:
      | databag          | databag_path                 |
      | envs             | ./data_bags/envs             |
      | git-data-viewer  | ./data_bags/git-data-viewer  |

    * the "chef-client::cron" recipe has been added to the "git-data-viewer" run list
    * the "git-data-viewer" role has been added to the "git-data-viewer" run list
    * the chef-client has been run on "git-data-viewer"

    * I ssh to "git-data-viewer" with the following credentials:
      | username | keyfile |
      | $lxc$    | $lxc$   |
